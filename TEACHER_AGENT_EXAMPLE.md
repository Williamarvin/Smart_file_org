# Master Teacher Agent - Complete API Workflow Example

This guide demonstrates the complete process of using the Master Teacher Agent system with real API endpoints and curl commands.

## Complete Workflow Overview

1. Select files/folders
2. Configure teacher agent settings
3. Generate teacher prompt with sections
4. Review and edit sections
5. Consolidate into final prompt
6. Execute teacher agent
7. Chat with teacher
8. Create validation report

## Step 1: Get Available Files and Folders

### List all files
```bash
curl -X GET https://smart-file-organiser.replit.app/api/files \
  -H "Accept: application/json"
```

Response example:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "4d0f1605-e103-4eca-8ecf-6415ef4a6f8b",
    "filename": "algebra-basics.pdf",
    "originalName": "Algebra Basics Guide.pdf",
    "processingStatus": "completed",
    "category": "Education"
  },
  {
    "id": "5e1f2716-f214-5fdb-9fde-7526fg5b7c9c",
    "filename": "math-exercises.pdf",
    "originalName": "Math Practice Exercises.pdf",
    "processingStatus": "completed",
    "category": "Education"
  }
]
```

### List all folders
```bash
curl -X GET https://smart-file-organiser.replit.app/api/folders \
  -H "Accept: application/json"
```

Response example:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "4c0044f3-bbba-45d9-85fe-a2f9ea8510c6",
    "name": "Mathematics",
    "path": "/Mathematics",
    "parentId": null
  }
]
```

## Step 2: Generate Teacher Prompt with Configuration

This is the main endpoint that generates the structured 5-section teacher prompt based on your configuration.

```bash
curl -X POST https://smart-file-organiser.replit.app/api/generate-teacher-prompt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "fileIds": ["4d0f1605-e103-4eca-8ecf-6415ef4a6f8b", "5e1f2716-f214-5fdb-9fde-7526fg5b7c9c"],
    "folderIds": ["4c0044f3-bbba-45d9-85fe-a2f9ea8510c6"],
    "courseTitle": "Introduction to Algebra",
    "targetAudience": "High school students (ages 14-16)",
    "additionalContext": "Focus on practical applications and real-world examples"
  }'
```

}
```

## Step 3: Execute the Teacher Prompt (Consolidated Version)

After reviewing and potentially editing the sections, execute the consolidated prompt:

```bash
curl -X POST https://smart-file-organiser.replit.app/api/execute-teacher-prompt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "[THE COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED PROMPT FROM STEP 2]",
    "selectedFiles": ["4d0f1605-e103-4eca-8ecf-6415ef4a6f8b", "5e1f2716-f214-5fdb-9fde-7526fg5b7c9c"],
    "selectedFolders": ["4c0044f3-bbba-45d9-85fe-a2f9ea8510c6"]
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "content": "Welcome to our algebra class! I'm excited to guide you through this fascinating journey into the world of algebraic thinking. Let me start by sharing why algebra is such a powerful tool...\n\n[Full teacher agent response with natural, conversational teaching style]",
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 2500,
    "completion_tokens": 1800,
    "total_tokens": 4300
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Chat with the Teacher Agent

Continue the conversation with context:

```bash
curl -X POST https://smart-file-organiser.replit.app/api/chat-teacher-agent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Can you explain the distributive property again with more examples?",
    "courseTitle": "Introduction to Algebra",
    "targetAudience": "High school students (ages 14-16)",
    "teachingStyle": "visual",
    "expertiseSubject": "mathematics",
    "conversationHistory": [
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Welcome to our algebra class! I am excited to guide you..."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Can you explain the distributive property again with more examples?"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "response": "Of course! Let me break down the distributive property with visual examples that will make it crystal clear.\n\nImagine you're at a pizza party. The distributive property is like this: if 3 friends each want 2 slices of pepperoni AND 1 slice of cheese, you can calculate the total in two ways:\n\nMethod 1: 3 × (2 + 1) = 3 × 3 = 9 slices\nMethod 2: (3 × 2) + (3 × 1) = 6 + 3 = 9 slices\n\nBoth give the same answer! That's the distributive property: a(b + c) = ab + ac\n\n[More examples with visual descriptions...]"
}
```

## Step 5: Save the Teacher Chat Session

Save the entire session for later use:

```bash
curl -X POST https://smart-file-organiser.replit.app/api/teacher-chat-sessions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Algebra Basics - First Lesson",
    "courseTitle": "Introduction to Algebra",
    "targetAudience": "High school students (ages 14-16)",
    "teachingStyle": "visual",
    "expertiseSubject": "mathematics",
    "teacherPrompt": "[FULL PROMPT FROM STEP 2]",
    "teacherContent": "[GENERATED CONTENT FROM STEP 3]",
    "chatHistory": [
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "Welcome to our algebra class..."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain the distributive property again?"},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "Of course! Let me break down..."}
    ],
    "selectedFiles": ["4d0f1605-e103-4eca-8ecf-6415ef4a6f8b"],
    "selectedFolders": ["4c0044f3-bbba-45d9-85fe-a2f9ea8510c6"]
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "id": "session-123-abc",
  "title": "Algebra Basics - First Lesson",
  "createdAt": "2025-08-21T10:30:00Z",
  "shareId": "share-xyz-789",
  "isPublic": 0
}
```

## Step 6: Create a Validation Report

Compare the actual chat session with the original parameters:

```bash
curl -X POST https://smart-file-organiser.replit.app/api/validation-reports/validate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "reportTitle": "Algebra Lesson Validation - Aug 21",
    "sessionId": "session-123-abc",
    "originalParameters": {
      "courseTitle": "Introduction to Algebra",
      "targetAudience": "High school students (ages 14-16)",
      "teachingStyle": "visual",
      "expertiseSubject": "mathematics",
      "actionTypes": ["ppt", "flashcards", "ppt", "quiz", "discussion"],
      "durations": [5, 10, 20, 15, 10],
      "difficultyLevels": ["beginner", "beginner", "intermediate", "intermediate", "intermediate"]
    },
    "chatHistory": [
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "Welcome to our algebra class..."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain the distributive property again?"},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "Of course! Let me break down..."}
    ]
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "id": "report-456-def",
  "reportTitle": "Algebra Lesson Validation - Aug 21",
  "complianceScore": 92.5,
  "deviations": [
    {
      "parameter": "teaching_style",
      "expected": "visual",
      "actual": "visual",
      "severity": "none",
      "impact": "Fully compliant"
    },
    {
      "parameter": "difficulty_progression",
      "expected": "beginner to intermediate",
      "actual": "maintained appropriately",
      "severity": "low",
      "impact": "Minor variation in complexity"
    }
  ],
  "createdAt": "2025-08-21T10:35:00Z"
}
```

## Step 7: Download Validation Report as PDF

```bash
curl -X GET https://smart-file-organiser.replit.app/api/validation-reports/report-456-def/pdf \
  -o "algebra-validation-report.pdf"
```

This downloads a PDF report with:
- Compliance score visualization
- Detailed parameter comparison
- Deviation analysis
- Recommendations for improvement

echo "Files retrieved"

# 2. Generate teacher prompt
echo "Generating teacher prompt..."
PROMPT_RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST https://smart-file-organiser.replit.app/api/generate-teacher-prompt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "fileIds": [],
    "folderIds": [],

TEACHER_RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST https://smart-file-organiser.replit.app/api/execute-teacher-prompt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"prompt\": \"Test prompt\",
    \"selectedFiles\": [],
    \"selectedFolders\": []
  }")
echo "Teacher executed"

# 4. Create validation report
echo "Creating validation report..."
VALIDATION=$(curl -s -X POST https://smart-file-organiser.replit.app/api/validation-reports/validate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "reportTitle": "Test Validation",
    "originalParameters": {
      "courseTitle": "Test Course",
      "teachingStyle": "visual",
      "difficultyLevels": ["beginner"]
    },
    "chatHistory": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "test"},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "test response"}
    ]
  }')
echo "Validation complete"

echo "Full workflow test completed!"
```
