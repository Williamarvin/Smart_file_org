# Overview

This is a full-stack file management and search application designed for uploading, processing, and searching documents and videos using AI-powered content analysis. The system extracts text from various file formats and transcribes video content, generates metadata and embeddings, and provides semantic search capabilities. It features a React frontend and Express.js backend, with a modern multi-page navigation system for dashboard overview, file browsing, uploading, and analytics. The project aims to provide a robust, AI-enhanced platform for efficient content organization and retrieval.
