# Overview

This is a full-stack document management and search application that allows users to upload, process, and search through documents and videos using AI-powered content analysis. The system extracts text from various file formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and transcribes video content using OpenAI's Whisper model, generates metadata and embeddings using OpenAI GPT-4o, and provides semantic search capabilities powered by PostgreSQL pgvector for optimized vector similarity search. Built with a React frontend and Express.js backend, the application features a modern multi-page navigation system with dedicated sections for dashboard overview, file browsing, uploading, and analytics.

# Recent Changes

## Database Performance Fix (Aug 12, 2025)
- **Issue**: Fixed critical database performance problem caused by storing large binary files (up to 65MB) in PostgreSQL bytea columns
- **Impact**: 351MB of bytea data was causing query timeouts and memory issues
- **Solution**: 
  - Increased bytea storage threshold to 100MB (per user request)
  - Fixed database queries to exclude bytea columns from SELECT statements
  - Modified getFile and getFilesWithoutBytea methods to avoid loading bytea data
  - Successfully backfilled all files under 100MB with dual storage
  - Updated storage strategy: files <100MB use dual storage, files â‰¥100MB use cloud-only
- **Result**: API response times improved from timeouts to ~375-619ms with full bytea functionality
- **Additional Protection**: Created files_safe database view to prevent accidental bytea column access
