## 🎯 Deployment Steps

### 1. **Click Deploy Button**
- In your Replit workspace, click the **"Deploy"** button at the top
- Choose **"Autoscale"** deployment (recommended for full-stack apps)
- Add payment method if prompted
- Replit will automatically handle the build and deployment

### 2. **Get Your Production URL**
After deployment completes, you'll receive a URL like:
```
https://[your-deployment-name].replit.app
```

### 3. **Update Domain References** 
Once you have your actual production URL, update these files:

**openapi.yaml** (line 30):
```yaml
- url: https://[your-actual-domain].replit.app/api
```

**API-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md** (line 14):
```
Production: https://[your-actual-domain].replit.app/api
```

## 🧪 Post-Deployment Testing

### Test Your Production API:
```bash
# Test authentication
curl https://[your-domain].replit.app/api/auth/user

# Test file listing
curl https://[your-domain].replit.app/api/files

# Test statistics
curl https://[your-domain].replit.app/api/stats

# Test search
curl https://[your-domain].replit.app/api/search/education

# Run comprehensive test suite
chmod +x test-api.sh
./test-api.sh https://[your-domain].replit.app
```

## 🌐 External API Access

Once deployed, your API will be accessible from any device:

```bash
# Example: Test from any computer/phone
curl https://[your-domain].replit.app/api/stats
```

Your OpenAPI specification (`openapi.yaml`) provides complete documentation for external integrations with JavaScript, Python, and cURL examples.

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Currently uses demo user authentication (safe for testing)
- For production use with real users, implement proper authentication
- All file uploads go through secure cloud storage
- API rate limiting handled by Replit infrastructure

## 📝 Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Test all endpoints** using the production URL
2. **Update any hardcoded localhost references** in your own integrations  
3. **Share your API** with external developers using the OpenAPI spec
4. **Monitor performance** through Replit's deployment dashboard
5. **Scale up** if needed (Replit handles this automatically)
