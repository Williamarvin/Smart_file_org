### **Step 2: The Issue of Food Waste**

**What is Food Waste?**
- Food waste refers to food that is discarded or uneaten. It's a significant global issue because:
  - Approximately one-third of all food produced is wasted.
  - It results in wasted resources like water and land.
  - Decomposing food in landfills produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas.

**Why Should We Care?**
- Reducing food waste can help conserve resources and minimize environmental harm.
- Addressing food waste can also help combat food insecurity by redirecting surplus food to those in need.

### **Step 3: Introduction to the A.R.E.S. Format**

The A.R.E.S. format helps you build a well-structured argument. Here's how it works:

1. **Assertion**: This is your main point or claim. It answers the question, "What are you arguing for?"

   - Example: "Supermarkets should donate unsold food."

2. **Reasoning**: This explains why your assertion is valid. It provides the logic behind your claim.

   - Example: "Donating food reduces waste and helps address food insecurity."

3. **Evidence**: This supports your reasoning with data, facts, or examples. It answers the question, "How can you prove your claim?"

   - Example: "Annually, 2.5 billion tons of food are wasted."

4. **Significance**: This highlights the importance of your argument. It explains the impact or relevance of your claim.

   - Example: "Promotes sustainability and supports vulnerable populations."

  - Example: "Schools should have mandatory recycling programs."

- **Reasoning**: Provide a logical explanation for your claim.
  - Example: "Recycling reduces waste and promotes environmental responsibility."

- **Evidence**: Support your reasoning with data or facts.
  - Example: "Recycling can cut school waste by up to 60%."

- **Significance**: Explain why your argument matters.
  - Example: "Encourages sustainable habits and reduces landfill use."
