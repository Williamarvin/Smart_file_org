Looking at your Smart File Organizer codebase, here's all the BYTEA-related code and optimization strategies for efficient storage/retrieval:

Current BYTEA Storage Code
Your current implementation stores complete file content as BYTEA in PostgreSQL:

Storage Location: postgres_db_connector.py - Lines 287-292:

cursor.execute("""
    INSERT INTO files (filename, file_id, file_size, file_content, upload_time)
    VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
    RETURNING id
""", (filename, file_id, len(file_content), file_content))
Table Schema:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS files (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    filename TEXT NOT NULL,
    file_id TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    file_size INTEGER,
    file_content BYTEA,  -- Complete binary file storage
    upload_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)
Performance Issues & Solutions
1. Chunked Storage System
Instead of storing entire files as single BYTEA, break them into chunks:
optimized_bytea_storage.py
Reverted
Create efficient chunked BYTEA storage system
2. Enhanced File Downloader with Streaming
efficient_file_downloader.py
Reverted
Create streaming file downloader for BYTEA
3. Database Optimization Strategies
bytea_performance_optimizer.py
Reverted
Database optimization strategies for BYTEA performance
Key Performance Tips:
Use Chunked Storage - Break large files into 1MB chunks to avoid loading entire files
Add Compression - Use gzip compression for text-heavy files (can reduce size by 70-90%)
Implement Caching - Cache frequently accessed files in Redis/memory
Stream Downloads - Use server-side streaming to avoid memory issues
Optimize Indexes - Create partial indexes for recent files only
Regular Maintenance - Run VACUUM ANALYZE after bulk operations
Replit-Specific Considerations:
10 GiB database limit - Use chunking and compression to maximize storage
Memory constraints - Stream files instead of loading entirely
Connection pooling - Reuse database connections efficiently
The optimized system can handle much larger files while using less memory and providing faster access times. The chunked approach also enables partial file loading and better concurrent access.
