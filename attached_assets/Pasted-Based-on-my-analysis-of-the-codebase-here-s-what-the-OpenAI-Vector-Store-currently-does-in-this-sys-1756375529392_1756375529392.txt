Based on my analysis of the codebase, here's what the OpenAI Vector Store currently does in this system:

Primary Functions of OpenAI Vector Store:
1. File Storage & Indexing
Stores uploaded file content directly in OpenAI's vector store
Creates embeddings automatically when files are added
Maintains file relationships with database records via openai_file_id
Syncs with PostgreSQL - adds missing files, removes orphaned ones
2. Semantic Search Engine
The vector store powers the "Layer 1" of the dual search system:

Current Implementation:

# Uses OpenAI's Responses API (not Assistants API)
response = self.client.responses.create(
    instructions="You are a semantic file search assistant...",
    model="gpt-4o",
    input=f"Find files semantically related to: {query}",
    tools=[{"type": "file_search", "vector_store_ids": [self.vector_store_id]}]
)
What it does:

Understands query intent - not just keywords but meaning
Finds conceptually related files - e.g., "tax documents" finds financial records
Considers synonyms and context - "homework" matches "assignments", "problem sets"
Returns semantic relevance scores based on content similarity
3. File Management
Automatic cleanup of failed or expired files
Statistics tracking - file counts, usage bytes, processing status
Metadata enrichment - stores categories, tags, confidence scores alongside content
4. Integration with Database
Two-way sync ensures consistency between vector store and PostgreSQL
Stores OpenAI file IDs in database for cross-referencing
Enables hybrid search combining semantic (vector) and keyword (SQL) results
Current Architecture:
Vector Store serves as:

Content repository for full file text and embeddings
Semantic search index powered by OpenAI's file_search tool
AI-enhanced discovery layer that understands document meaning and context
Notable limitation: The system currently uses two different vector store names:

"smart_file_organizer_v2" (in vector_index.py)
"Smart File Organizer Vector Store" (in dual_search_engine.py)
This could cause inconsistencies - the system may create multiple vector stores instead of using a single unified one.

The vector store essentially acts as an intelligent file index that enables natural language search across document content, going far beyond simple keyword matching to understand document purpose and semantic relationships.
