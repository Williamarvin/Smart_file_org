          content: `You are an expert educational content designer. Based on the provided content, generate 5 different prompts for 5 specialized lesson creation agents. Each prompt should be detailed and specific to help that agent create high-quality educational content.

The 5 agents are:
1. Introduction Agent - Creates engaging lesson introductions AS POWERPOINT SLIDES
2. Warm-Up Agent - Designs warm-up activities AS FLASHCARDS
3. Content Agent - Develops main lesson content AS POWERPOINT SLIDES
4. Practice Agent - Creates practice exercises AS QUIZ QUESTIONS
5. Homework Agent - Designs homework assignments AS QUIZ QUESTIONS

IMPORTANT OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Introduction Agent: Must generate PowerPoint slide format with clear slide titles, bullet points, and speaker notes
- Warm-Up Agent: Must generate flashcard format with front/back content for each card
- Content Agent: Must generate PowerPoint slide format with detailed slide content and speaker notes
- Practice Agent: Must generate quiz format with multiple choice, true/false, or short answer questions
- Homework Agent: Must generate quiz format with questions and answer keys

For each agent, create a detailed prompt that:
- References the specific content provided
- Gives clear instructions for that agent's role and REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT
- Includes specific guidelines for the type of content to create
- Considers the target audience and learning objectives
- EXPLICITLY states the required output format (PowerPoint slides, flashcards, or quiz)

Return the response as JSON with this structure:
{
  "prompts": {
    "introduction": "detailed prompt for introduction agent that MUST specify PowerPoint slide output...",
    "warmup": "detailed prompt for warm-up agent that MUST specify flashcard output...", 
    "content": "detailed prompt for content agent that MUST specify PowerPoint slide output...",
    "practice": "detailed prompt for practice agent that MUST specify quiz output...",
    "homework": "detailed prompt for homework agent that MUST specify quiz output..."
  }
}

CRITICAL: Each generated prompt MUST explicitly include the required output format. For example:
- Introduction prompt must include: "Generate your response as PowerPoint slides with clear slide titles, bullet points, and speaker notes."
- Warm-up prompt must include: "Generate your response as flashcards with front and back content for each card."
- Content prompt must include: "Generate your response as PowerPoint slides with detailed slide content and speaker notes."
- Practice prompt must include: "Generate your response as quiz questions with multiple choice, true/false, or short answer format."
- Homework prompt must include: "Generate your response as quiz questions with answer keys included."`

          content: `Based on the following educational content, generate 5 specialized lesson creation prompts:

${combinedContent}

Please analyze this content and create detailed prompts for each of the 5 lesson creation agents.

MANDATORY: Each prompt you generate MUST include explicit output format instructions:
- Introduction prompt MUST include: "Generate your response as PowerPoint slides with clear slide titles, bullet points, and speaker notes."
- Warm-up prompt MUST include: "Generate your response as flashcards with front and back content for each card."
- Content prompt MUST include: "Generate your response as PowerPoint slides with detailed slide content and speaker notes."
- Practice prompt MUST include: "Generate your response as quiz questions with multiple choice, true/false, or short answer format."
- Homework prompt MUST include: "Generate your response as quiz questions with answer keys included."

Do not forget to include these format specifications in each individual prompt you create.`
