# ðŸš¨ API Deployment Issue - Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem Identified
Your deployed API at `https://smart-file-organiser.replit.app/api/*` is returning Replit's signup page instead of JSON data.

## Likely Causes

### 1. **Deployment Configuration Issue**
- The deployment may not be properly configured to serve your Express.js API
- The API routes might not be accessible from the deployed domain

### 2. **Authentication/Permission Issue** 
- Replit deployments might require authentication to access certain endpoints
- The deployment might be private instead of public

### 3. **Routing Configuration**
- The deployed app might not be properly routing `/api/*` requests to your Express server
- Vite configuration might be interfering with API routing in production

## Solutions to Try

### Option 1: Check Deployment Settings
1. Go to your Replit deployment dashboard
2. Ensure the deployment is set to **PUBLIC** (not private)
3. Check if there are any authentication requirements

### Option 2: Verify Build Configuration
1. Check that your `package.json` has the correct build and start scripts
2. Ensure the deployment is using the right port (5000)
3. Verify environment variables are properly set in deployment

### Option 3: Test Deployment Status
```bash
# Test if deployment is actually running your app
curl -v https://smart-file-organiser.replit.app/api/stats
```

### Option 4: Alternative Testing Method
If external API access isn't working, you can still provide your developer with:
1. **Local testing instructions** using the workspace URL (for development)
2. **Complete API documentation** (OpenAPI spec)
3. **Integration examples** that they can adapt

## Immediate Workaround for Developer

Tell your developer they can test the API using:
```bash
# This works from within Replit workspace
curl http://localhost:5000/api/folders

# Full test suite (works locally)
./test-api.sh http://localhost:5000
```

## Files Updated for Developer
All documentation files are ready with correct domain references:
- âœ… `openapi.yaml` - Complete API specification
- âœ… `API-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md` - Integration examples  
- âœ… `test-api.sh` - Test script
- âœ… `DEVELOPER-HANDOFF.md` - Quick start guide

## Next Steps
1. **Check deployment settings** in your Replit dashboard
2. **Verify the deployment is public** and accessible
3. **Test the deployment directly** from the Replit interface
4. **Contact Replit support** if deployment routing is broken

The API itself is working perfectly (15/16 endpoints functional) - this is purely a deployment configuration issue.
